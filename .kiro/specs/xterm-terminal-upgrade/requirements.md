# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature upgrades the current basic terminal implementation in CLI Buddy to use xterm.js, the same terminal emulator library used by VS Code. This will provide a professional-grade terminal experience with proper terminal emulation, ANSI color support, and better performance for handling large amounts of output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a CLI Buddy user, I want a professional terminal interface that behaves like VS Code's integrated terminal, so that I can have a familiar and powerful terminal experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the terminal component loads THEN the system SHALL display an xterm.js terminal instance
2. WHEN I type commands THEN the terminal SHALL provide proper cursor movement and text editing capabilities
3. WHEN commands produce output THEN the terminal SHALL display ANSI colors and formatting correctly
4. WHEN I resize the terminal window THEN the terminal SHALL automatically adjust its dimensions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using CLI Buddy, I want the terminal to handle real shell processes, so that I can execute actual system commands and see their output in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a command THEN the system SHALL execute it in a real shell process
2. WHEN a command produces output THEN the terminal SHALL stream the output in real-time
3. WHEN a command completes THEN the terminal SHALL return to the prompt state
4. WHEN a long-running command is executed THEN I SHALL be able to see output as it's produced

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CLI Buddy user, I want the terminal to maintain command history and support standard terminal shortcuts, so that I can work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press the up arrow key THEN the terminal SHALL show the previous command
2. WHEN I press the down arrow key THEN the terminal SHALL show the next command in history
3. WHEN I press Ctrl+C THEN the terminal SHALL interrupt the current process
4. WHEN I press Ctrl+L THEN the terminal SHALL clear the screen

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CLI Buddy user, I want the terminal to integrate seamlessly with the Electron application, so that it works reliably across different operating systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the terminal SHALL initialize with the user's default shell
2. WHEN running on different operating systems THEN the terminal SHALL use the appropriate shell (bash/zsh on macOS/Linux, cmd/PowerShell on Windows)
3. WHEN the terminal encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN the application is closed THEN any running terminal processes SHALL be properly terminated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining CLI Buddy, I want the terminal implementation to be well-tested, so that it remains reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terminal functionality is implemented THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests
2. WHEN the terminal component is rendered THEN tests SHALL verify proper xterm.js initialization
3. WHEN terminal methods are called THEN tests SHALL verify expected behavior
4. WHEN the test suite runs THEN all terminal-related tests SHALL pass
