# CLI Buddy

CLI Buddy is a GUI companion for agentic AI CLI tools like Gemini CLI and Claude Code. Built as an Electron app with Vue.js, it provides project management capabilities focused on documentation-driven workflows and AI agent integration.

## Core Purpose

Manages projects that produce material and artifacts beyond source code - research projects, knowledge bases, documentation repositories. Similar to how Git GUIs complement the Git CLI or how AI agents integrate into IDEs like Cursor, CLI Buddy bridges the gap between CLI-based AI agents and visual project management.

## Key Features

- **Agent Integration Management**: Steering documentation, specs, MCP server configurations, and hooks
- **Artifact Management**: Material and documentation organization (primarily .md files used as AI context)
- **Version Control Integration**: Git management for tracking project changes
- **Agent Agnostic Design**: Works with any CLI-based AI agent, not tied to specific providers
- **CLI-Centric Approach**: Complements rather than replaces command-line workflows

## Target Users

- Researchers managing documentation-heavy projects
- Knowledge workers building content repositories
- Teams using AI agents for non-code deliverables
- Users wanting resilience across evolving AI agent ecosystems

## Value Proposition

Leverages existing AI tool subscriptions while providing visual management for complex, documentation-driven projects that benefit from AI agent assistance.
